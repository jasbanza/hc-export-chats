Can you tell me what error message you're seeing?\n[USER] It says 'insufficient funds' but I have enough OSMO in my wallet\n[AGENT] That usually indicates you don't have enough OSMO to cover the gas fees. Do you have at least 0.1 OSMO extra for transaction fees?\n[USER] Oh I see, let me add more OSMO for gas\n[AGENT] Perfect! Make sure to keep some OSMO for gas fees in future transactions.
